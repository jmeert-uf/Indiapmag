This notebook will take University of Florida Molspin data files (IAPD formatted) and convert them for use and analysis in PmagPy.   Files can be analyzed in the DemagGUI and then prepared for upload into the Magic Database.
Put each site in a separate folder and separate AF and thermal samples from one another.  
Change file names and paths as required.
